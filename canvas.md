CSM Copilot — Hackathon Project OverviewGoal:
 Build an AI-powered Copilot that helps Customer Success Managers (CSMs) prep smarter for customer meetings by automatically gathering, summarizing, and contextualizing customer data — across Salesforce, Gainsight, and support systems.

The Problem:
From our chat with @Daire  (SurveyMonkey CSM), we learned:

* CSMs manually pull data from multiple tools before every meeting.
* Feature requests vanish after submission — no visibility or updates.
* Customer context is scattered across Salesforce, Gainsight, and support tickets.
* Growth CSMs manage too many accounts to prep deeply each time.
    

Quote:
“If we had an AI that plugs into all our tools, and pulls it together and I can ask it questions, that would be amazing!.” — @Daire , CSM

The Solution:
CSM Copilot is an AI workspace that:

* Generates Customer Stories — summaries of feedback, tickets, and key interactions.
* Combines business data (ARR, usage, renewal health) with sentiment insights.
* Offers a chat-based Copilot to ask questions like:

“Show me all open feature requests for this account.”
 “Summarize recent support tickets and customer sentiment.”
The output: Instant customer context and meeting-ready insights.
